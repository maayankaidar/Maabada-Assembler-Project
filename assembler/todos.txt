Understand why errors are shorter than what suppose to be.
examples:
* "MAIN: mov @r9, LENGTH"
 the error needs to be "Invalid register number" but somehow what is thrown is "Invalid regi"
* jmp
 the error needs to be "Missing operand." but somehow what is thrown is "Missing oper"

fix bug with extern symbols in the second pass -
the function get_symbol_address() CAN'T RETURN 1 if the decimal address is -1. think of another solution.

add errors printing

move all errors texts to errors file

Create a HUGE as file containing all types of errors.

debug first pass and clean

finish second pass

write files extern and entry (only if exist)

delete temp files

add docstring to every function

1. Understand why errors are shorter than what suppose to be.
examples:
* "MAIN: mov @r9, LENGTH"
 the error needs to be "Invalid register number" but somehow what is thrown is "Invalid regi"
* jmp
 the error needs to be "Missing operand." but somehow what is thrown is "Missing oper"

2. Create a HUGE as file containing all types of errors.

3. debug first pass and clean

4. finish second pass

5. decode binary and write files

6. be happy
